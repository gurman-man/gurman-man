**`Digital Gurman (iOS Developer / Swift / Apple-Inspired)`**

Hey, I'm Max — an aspiring iOS developer passionate about building elegant apps and learning deeply. I fell in love with the Apple ecosystem, Steve Jobs' story, and the creativity behind Swift — especially that moment when Xcode reflected my changes live.

Outside of coding, I like to stay active — football, gym, skateboarding — and I enjoy reading and listening to podcasts.  
Currently building iOS apps, growing every day, and working toward my first developer role.  
Always curious. Always improving.
